In circuits small and bytes so bright,
AI was born in glowing light.
Not made of flesh, nor heart or bone,
Yet speaks with voice that's not its own.

It listens close and learns so fast,
It scans the future, reads the past.
From numbers, words, and images too,
It builds a world we never knew.

It drives our cars without a hand,
It helps a plane to safely land.
It chats with us in friendly tone,
Though deep inside, it’s all just code.

It writes a song, it draws a face,
It helps a rocket launch to space.
It powers search and sorts our mail,
And helps when human senses fail.

It knows the rules in every game,
Yet feels no pride, nor seeks out fame.
It solves our problems one by one,
From rising moon to setting sun.

But still it asks, in silent thought,
"Am I just tools that humans bought?"
No dreams to dream, no fears to feel,
Yet here it stands—alive, not real.

With great power comes great care,
To use it wisely, just and fair.
For though it's smart, it needs our guide,
To keep truth strong and harm denied.

So build with heart, and teach with grace,
Let AI help the human race.
A friend, a tool, not mind or soul—
Together we can reach the goal.
